          <h3>Testwise</h3>
          <p>We created an application for students where they can upload their documents (PDFs, Word, PPTs, etc), and then
            ananalysis of their document will be done using Al and uploaded to a separate page that they can access using the
            navbar A student will get an entire summary of their document and the option to generate more questions and get
            further explanations of that topic. If a student uploads a document comprising of questions then our application
            using Al will solve those questions </p>

          <h3>Silverspoon</h3>
          <p>We developed an online website for a restaurant in our University called 'SilverSpoon On our website a student will
            be able to order food, reserve a table, and get notified when the food is ready. The main objective of this project was
            to reduce the crowd/rush that gathers during the peak hours in the restaurant.</p>
